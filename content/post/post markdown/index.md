## Overview

Markdown, or markdown, is a markup language for text documents. It allows you to create texts without using Word and other editors. The markup can be read and rendered on any system or browser.

Markdown was created by writer and blogger John Gruber along with web activist Aaron Schwartz. They wanted to come up with the simplest and most convenient markup language with which text can be translated into a beautifully designed look. At the same time, the text must remain readable even without being reduced to a “beautiful” look. This is what Markdown turned out to be. It was created in 2004, but the language has gained the most popularity now. It is supported by a variety of blogging platforms, note-taking services, CMS, and even instant messengers. Therefore, markdown is useful for everyone who deals with the web, from developers to bloggers.


How to use the markup language

A person writes text in any editor and adds special combinations of standard characters to it. This is the markup, it shows where the text should be bold, where the heading should be, and where the list should be. Symbols can be used to mark up headings, text highlights, and even complex structures like tables. Special converters form a finished document based on the markup. It's similar to using HTML, but the markdown is simpler and the text is more readable. Converters are either pre-installed in a text editor, such as a note-taking app, or are downloaded separately.

Who Uses Markdown?

1. Internet users who communicate in instant messengers and write notes in services that support markup.
2. Developers who write documentation for projects using markdown need a simple and reliable tool.
3. Content managers when filling sites that support markdown. The markup can also be used on web pages.
4. Bloggers who write longreads when they design materials for articles. Many writing platforms support markdown, such as Notion.
5. Writers and copywriters who want a simple text styling tool - markup that is readable on any device.
6. Enthusiasts who use markup for personal purposes: write notes and to-do lists, keep diaries or create memory cards.
