## Overview

Last week was very informative and interesting, it turned out to be productive for me.

Last week I visited the Maly Theatre, one of the oldest theaters in Russia. His troupe was created at Moscow University in 1756, immediately after the decree of Empress Elizaveta Petrovna, which marked the birth of a professional theater in the country.
